This readme file describes the algorithm for calculating 0.5 x 0.5 degree 
latitude x longitude grid-cell area for the globe.  
Grid-cells are centered on 0.25 degrees.

Data Policy:
These data products are being distributed free of charge. 
Recipients have a responsibility to: 

    1. Acknowledge the University of New Hampshire, 
       EOS-WEBSTER Earth Science Information Partner (ESIP) 
       as the data distributor for this dataset.

Description:
Many research efforts address the changes in biogeochemical cycles from 
environmental variability in climate and other drivers in both space and 
time. One method of inquiry is through development and use of ecosystem 
simulation models that use spatially referenced information on climate, 
elevation, soils, vegetation, and water availability to make estimates 
of important fluxes of carbon, water, and nitrogen. 
The Global Model Reference Data collection contains a set of reference data
 that have been used and continue to be used in many published climate change 
studies. These reference data include elevation, vegetation classification, 
soil texture, wetland soil types, grid-cell area, and grid-cell 
classification by continent.

Spatial Extent:
Global

Data Range:
Data are 32 bit float.  
Data Range: 363.00 - 3090.00
Data Units: sq km
Fill Value: -9999.0

Projection: These data are gridded in the geographic projection with 
0.5 degree by 0.5 degree cell sizes.  There are 720 cells in the x dimension 
(longitude) and 292 cells in the y dimension (latitude) in the original 
data set, although this will vary if you ordered an area less than the 
full spatial extent.

Center points of the bounding corners of original data set:
N 89.75
S -55.75
E 179.75
W -179.75
 

Equations used in calculating the area of 0.5 degree latitude x longitude 
grid-cells. Area is calculated using the latitude at the upper bound 
of the grid-cell.


    Convert to radians:
     radians = (90.0 - (lat+0.25))*3.141593/180.0
    Calculate cosines:
     cosines = cosine(radians)-cosine(radians + (0.5*3.141593)/180.0))
    Calculate area in 
    square kilometers:
     area = (6371221.3*6371221.3*3.141593*cosines/360.0)*1.0e-6
    hectares:
     area = (6371221.3*6371221.3*3.141593*cosines/360.0)*0.0001
    acres:
     area = (6371221.3*6371221.3*3.141593*cosines/360.0)**0.00024710538
