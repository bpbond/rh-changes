# rh-changes

The [2010 Nature paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7288/full/nature08930.html) concluded by saying yeah, Rs is increasing, but we don't know if this is an acceleration of the C cycle, or a feedback. **Can we test this?**

Potential lines of evidence:
- RH/RS temporal trend
- RH response to climate anomalies
- RS relationship to Fluxnet GPP
- RS relationship to MODIS and Beer GPP
- RS relationship to SIF

Next steps?
- update SRDB (below)
- Check Hashimoto, Hursh papers for factors affecting Rs and Rh, include
- Could we calculate a Q10 or flux from this? Hmm.

SRDB updating priority:
- ~~2013 and 2014 studies reporting RH and RS~~
- ~~2015 studies reporting RS and/or RH~~
- missed Epule studies
- At this point, we have more-or-less-final rh-changes dataset
- other 2013-2015 studies (and then write Scientific Data paper)
