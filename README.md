# rh-changes

The [2010 Nature paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7288/full/nature08930.html) concluded by saying yeah, Rs is increasing, but we don't know if this is an acceleration of the C cycle, or a feedback.

With eight (if I enter 2014-2016) more years' data, **can we test this**?

Next steps?
- Process MODIS GPP and run tests
- SRDB - update; prioritize studies reporting Rh
- Check Hashimoto, Hursh papers for factors affecting Rs and Rh, include
- Could we calculate a Q10 or flux from this? Hmm.
