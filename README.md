# rh-changes

The [2010 Nature paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7288/full/nature08930.html) concluded by saying yeah, Rs is increasing, but we don't know if this is an acceleration of the C cycle, or a feedback.

With eight (if I enter 2014-2016) more years' data, **can we test this**?

Lines of evidence:
- RH/RS temporal trend
- RH response to climate anomalies
- RS relationship to Fluxnet GPP
- RS relationship to MODIS and Beer GPP
- RS relationship to SIF (?)

Next steps?
- update SRDB (below)
- Check Hashimoto, Hursh papers for factors affecting Rs and Rh, include
- Could we calculate a Q10 or flux from this? Hmm.
- make a Fluxnet field in database? Or other way to match select data with FLUXNET data

SRDB updating priority:
- ~~2013 and 2014 studies reporting RH and RS~~
- 2015 studies reporting RS and/or RH
- missed Epule studies
- At this point, we have 'final' rh-changes dataset
- other 2013-2015 studies
