Hi Ben

FLUXNET2015 has not citation (see the data policy). You can use 
Baldocchi 2008 (Australian Journal of Botany) as reference for FLUXNET 
in general.

For the sites what is important is to have the table in the paper and 
use the FLUXNET official codes. For papers related to the stations we 
are collecting them so a comprehensive list is not available yet. 
However I attached a table and references from a paper published using 
the LaThuile data where a lot of sites are the same. For the others you 
could also contact the PIs...

ciao
