# rh-changes

The [2010 Nature paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7288/full/nature08930.html) concluded by saying yeah, Rs is increasing, but we don't know if this is an acceleration of the C cycle, or a feedback.

With eight (if I enter 2014-2016) more years' data, **can we test this**?

Next steps?
- SRDB - update (below)
- Check Hashimoto, Hursh papers for factors affecting Rs and Rh, include
- Could we calculate a Q10 or flux from this? Hmm.

SRDB updating priority:
- ~~2013 and 2014 studies obviously reporting RH~~
- 2013 and 2014 studies obviously reporting RS
- 2015 studies obviously reporting RH
- 2015 studies obviously reporting RS
- other 2013-2015 studies
- 2016
