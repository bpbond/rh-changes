# reproducibility

Ecological and climate change science has to be [reproducible](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02693.x) and [open](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1197962) with clear [data provenance](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.114).




This folder contains the two files that are the outputs of earlier scripts (in particular `2-prepdata.R`, which is expensive to run and uses lots of large datasets not included in this repository). These file can be copied into `outputs/` and used to run the main analysis script, `4-analysis.R`.

This folder also contains the log files produced by every script. These contain the analytical results, but also (and perhaps more importantly) the R package and session information used.
